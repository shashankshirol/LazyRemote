# LazyRemote

Picture this, you are watching a series/movie on you PC and to enjoy the content better you switch from your uncomfortable chair to your bed only to realize the volume is too low or you missed a scene while munching on chips. This has happened to the best of us. But, fret not for now we have LazyRemote.

## Usage:

- Run the python script in the background. Open up the host webpage it shows on the terminal and Voila, all the necessary controls on your PHONE!!!
- But, what if other people open the host webpage and start tinkering with your controls? Don't worry! LazyRemote has you covered, when accessing your host webpage, enter the REFERENCE number that is generated randomly every session. So, no one can control your PC except for YOU!
- Take a look at the images below to get a better idea!

## Requirements:

- `python 3.6+`
- And, everything in the `requirements.txt` file. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- MOST IMPORTANTLY, this has only been tested on Windows. Don't know if it'll work on Linux/MacOS.
- FINALLY, to be a lazy bum.

## Use-cases:

Apart from having to change volume and seeking to a missed part, LazyRemote can also:

- Pause/Play content using the SPACE key
- Allow seeking to a particular point using the ENTER key (Useful on Netflix)
- And, if you are feeling frisky and watching something you shouldn't (We don't judge, promise), LazyRemote can also trigger a hotkey (CTRL+F4) to close the current tab (works on Chrome)
